    review: 'Got my site up and running after I was burned by another freelancer. He gave me a discount, even though he couldn\'t make use of any of the code from the previous developer. Actually felt like Jeremy cared about the project, and wasn\'t just trying to make a quick buck. He went above and beyond what was expected.'
